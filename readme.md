## v0.0.37

## Notes
- There is ABSOLUTLEY NO randomness in this. This is 100% determanistic. EXCEPT for the level generation (not toggled) & candy Spawning.
- make sure you vs opp turn it is makes it into the state
- I can either go off the assumption that for every 1 node taking 20 inputs, it need 5 nodes in the middle, OR can try some NEAT inspired implimentation.
- dont forget if all else fails I can force 1 hot encoding for any network
